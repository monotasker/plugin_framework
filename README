## About

This plugin was developed (and continues to grow) in response to my desire to:
- use LESS css preprocessing with web2py
- develop a modular toolkit of reusable style settings and elements for my web2py apps
- allow for easy theming (and sub-theming) of the default layout
- implement web2py's provisions for modular content regions in a portable and reusable way

Essentially, plugin_framework is based on two principles:
1. Layout and styles should be DRY too.
2. Any visual styles I develop should be easily reusable in another project.

## Current status

At present plugin_framework is fairly idiosyncratic. It has only been abstracted enough to allow style reuse across five or six of my own projects (albeit projects with very different structures). My hope is to continue development so that it becomes more and more useful to other people as well.

## Usage and examples

Coming soon...
