/*
A css framework for web2py
based on Bootstrap, FontAwesome, and the web2py "welcome" application
and modularized using LESS css.

This is a hub file which aggregates the various reusable class files. This file
should then be imported into a my-theme.less file, which will provide 
specific details and overrides for the project at hand.

That my-theme.less file should then be imported into a file called
myapp/static/css/theme.less. If that file is pre-compiled into css, the 
resulting theme.css file can serve as the only css import listed in the head 
of framework.html. If you are going to use dynamic compiling via javascript,
just list the myapp/static/css/theme.less itself in the page head.
